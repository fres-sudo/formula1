- [ ] To start a new game just move the player in one of the near 8 buttons available to make it move.
      
- [ ] The game follows the rules of the original vector rally:

   - Each turn you can speed up (accelerate), slow down (decelerate) or maintain the same speed. When you accelerate from the starting point (the gray cross on the left), you start by moving 1 square. The next turn you move 2 squares, then squares, and so on. So when accelerating you increase the number of squares by 1 each turn.
     
   -  When decelerating you do the opposite, you decrease the number of squares by 1 each turn. So when you move 5 squares, the next turn you move 4 squares, then 3, and so on, until you come to a stop. You can also choose to maintain the same speed by moving the same number of squares as on the previous turn.
     
 - [ ] If a player goes above the limit of the track, it is consider a crash and the game will restart.
       
 - [ ] The first player taht make a lap win the race and the game restart itself.
       
 - [ ] The user can easly force restart the game by pressing the red button.
